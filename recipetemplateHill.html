                <li>12 ounce Crawfish</li>
                <li>Large Shrimp (5)</li>
                <li>Green onion</li>
                <li>Red bell pepper</li>
                <li>Green pepper</li>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Pure Dairy cream 1 Cup</li>
                <li>Persimmon cheese</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Firest we will slice and chop green onion, red bell pepper, green pepper, Garlic and slice our 6 tomatoes. Also we collect all ingredients at one place, so that we can start cooking.</li>
                <li>Take 5 Large Shrimp and make two small slits on them, when you cook your shrimp they don't throw it up and curl it too much. Throw these shrimps in a bowl, season them with some old bay tongues. Leave them for rest.</li>
                <li>Now I got my stove on medium heat with olive oil. Use 1/2 a stick of butter, add Cajun seasoning, add mushrooms(if you have). Now add sliced green onion, red bell pepper, green pepper, garlic and tomatoes. Cook them well.</li>
                <li>Take a boiling bowl and start boiling the linguine pasta. You can use any of your favorites. Boil for around 3 minutes and when boiling add a little amount of salt and olive oil. Take out your pasta from boiling after 3 minutes and leave it for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Set another pan on heat and take another half of the butter. Grill shrimps on it and grill them well.</li>
                <li>On the first pan add some dairy pure cream. It will make our dish very creamy and delicious. Don't rush, cook it wekl for the best creamy taste.</li>
                <li>After cooking for around 5-6 minutes, add some lemon juice on our creamy first pan. And add the crow fish in it. And cook it for another 3 minutes. Then add some persimmon cheese on it. Add the grilled shrimp into it and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Take your pasta on a serving plate and add the filling on it. You can mix it up according to your taste. It's now ready to serve.</li>
